# NYX Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The NYX system is a recursive fractal orchestration AI that uses deterministic and probabilistic signals to generate structured outputs. The system is built from a hierarchy of orchestrators and agents that recursively coordinate subtasks, track memory, and interface with external tools.

## Core Components

### 1. Top-Level Orchestrator
- Initiates workflows based on external prompts, internal memory triggers, or scheduled reviews
- Routes tasks downward to appropriate agents
- References global memory to maintain continuity
- Can be triggered by single user prompt or recursive goal updates

### 2. Recursive Sub-Orchestrators
- Spawned dynamically to handle decomposed subtasks
- Use same orchestration logic as top-level controller
- Maintain local memory, reasoning, and feedback scores
- Operate independently but coherently within parent context

### 3. Agent Types

#### Task Agents
- Execute bounded functions (document generation, code synthesis, task decomposition)
- **Support recursive spawning** of child agents for complex tasks
- **Persistent coordination state** during child agent execution
- **Result aggregation and synthesis** from multiple child outputs
- Retry logic with configurable limits and state recovery

#### Council Agents
- Debate alternatives using preset roles (Engineer, Strategist, Dissenter)
- Commissioned for complex decision-making and failure analysis
- **Can spawn validator agents** for recommendation verification
- Generate consensus recommendations with collaborative state management

#### Validator Agents
- Apply static rules and catch errors using LLM and deterministic validation
- Enforce system constraints and safety policies
- **Multi-level validation** (Basic, Standard, Strict, Critical)
- Validate outputs before propagation with detailed failure analysis

#### Memory Agents
- Handle context persistence and feedback integration
- **Persistent agents** for ongoing memory management across workflows
- Cross-agent context sharing and memory retrieval
- Support both session-scoped and global memory operations

### Agent State Management

**Comprehensive State Machine** supporting both single-use and recursive coordination patterns:

```
SPAWNED → ACTIVE → WAITING → COORDINATING → COMPLETED → TERMINATED
    ↓         ↓         ↓           ↓           ↓
    ↓         ↓         ↓           ↓           ↓  
   FAILED ←──────────────────────────────────────
```

**State Descriptions**:
- **SPAWNED**: Agent created, initializing resources
- **ACTIVE**: Agent executing primary task or ready for coordination  
- **WAITING**: Agent waiting for child agents to complete (recursive scenarios)
- **COORDINATING**: Agent aggregating child results and synthesizing output
- **COMPLETED**: Task finished successfully, agent ready for cleanup
- **FAILED**: Execution failed, retry logic or error recovery in progress
- **TERMINATED**: Agent lifecycle ended, resources cleaned up

**Key Requirements**:
- **Single-use agents**: `SPAWNED → ACTIVE → COMPLETED → TERMINATED`
- **Recursive coordination**: `ACTIVE → WAITING → COORDINATING → COMPLETED`
- **Error recovery**: Any state can transition to `FAILED` with retry logic
- **Resource management**: Long-lived agents tracked for proper cleanup

### 4. Tool Interface Layer
- Agents call shell, Python, or API functions
- Logs every call with inputs, outputs, failures, and retry history
- Integrates with standard development toolchains
- Initial tools: shell commands, file operations, web requests

## System Behaviors

### Recursive Task Decomposition
**Core Requirement**: The primary purpose of the NYX system is to decompose complex tasks into granular, atomic operations that LLMs can handle deterministically.

**Agent Lifecycle for Recursion**:
- **Parent agents must persist** while coordinating child agent execution
- **State transitions support coordination**: `ACTIVE → WAITING → COORDINATING → COMPLETED`
- **Hierarchical agent trees** with parent-child relationships maintained throughout execution
- **Result aggregation** happens over extended time periods, requiring persistent agent state

**Example Recursive Pattern**:
```
TaskAgent("Write comprehensive API documentation")
├─ spawns TaskAgent("Generate OpenAPI schemas") → COMPLETED
├─ spawns TaskAgent("Write authentication guide") → COMPLETED  
└─ spawns TaskAgent("Create code examples")
   ├─ spawns TaskAgent("Python SDK example") → COMPLETED
   └─ spawns TaskAgent("JavaScript client example") → COMPLETED
   └─ [Parent waits, aggregates results, synthesizes final output]
```

**Critical Design Implications**:
- Agents cannot be single-use for recursive scenarios
- Parent agents require **coordination state** during child execution
- **Resource management** must account for long-lived agent trees
- **State persistence** is essential for deep recursion chains

### Fractal Execution Model
- Every agent can recursively spawn more agents
- Parallel processing capabilities with coordination overhead
- Cross-talk and context sharing between agents
- **Parent agents maintain active state** during child coordination

### Self-Initiation Triggers
- Agents act without user input based on:
  - Time thresholds
  - Failure patterns
  - Uncertainty levels
  - Internal goal updates

### Reinforcement Feedback (Static, Not ML)
- Deterministic scoring for quality, speed, and success
- Memory weighting adjusts future task planning priority
- Database-stored metrics for continuous improvement

### Error Handling and Recovery
- Task-level retries with exponential backoff
- Council sessions for persistent failure analysis
- Cascading failure containment
- Re-initiation with improved parameters/prompts
