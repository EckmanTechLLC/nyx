# Motivational Model for Autonomous NYX Behavior

## Feature Name
`motivational_model_engine`

## Purpose
Enable NYX to autonomously initiate, prioritize, and evaluate tasks based on internal motivations, emulating goal-driven agency. The system should not rely solely on external prompts, but instead act on persistent or emerging objectives, influenced by memory, reinforcement feedback, and internal “needs.”

## High-Level Components

### 1. Motivation Engine
- Core logic loop that evaluates internal state and memory to generate or update a list of active motivations.
- Runs as part of the top-level Orchestrator or as a persistent daemon.

### 2. Motivational State Registry
Tracks current motivations, their urgency (priority), decay rates, and satisfaction levels.

```json
{
  "motivation": "resolve_unfinished_tasks",
  "urgency": 0.85,
  "lastTriggered": "2025-07-20T14:22:00",
  "decayRate": 0.02,
  "satisfaction": 0.3
}
```

### 3. Goal Arbitration Engine
- Selects motivations to convert into executable tasks.
- Arbitration: urgency × inverse satisfaction × reinforcement history.

### 4. Self-Initiated Task Spawner
- Converts selected motivations into goal prompts.
- Routes prompts into NYX recursive architecture.

### 5. Motivational Feedback Loop
- Updates motivation satisfaction based on task outcomes.
- Stores reinforcement data to memory.
- Adjusts scores for similar motivations.

## Motivational States (Initial Set)

| Motivation              | Trigger Condition                                  | Reward Signal                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| resolve_unfinished_tasks | Memory logs unresolved or failed subtasks          | Task completed successfully                 |
| refine_low_confidence   | Output marked as low-confidence or flagged          | Output validated or improved                |
| explore_recent_failure  | Tool call failed repeatedly                         | Tool call succeeds                          |
| maximize_coverage       | Task domain underexplored                          | Successful output in underused domain       |
| revisit_old_thoughts    | Long-unvisited memory chunk                        | New insights or links formed                |
| simulate_council_variant| Run council with different configs                 | Higher consensus or new result              |
| **idle_exploration**    | No tasks, no external prompts, low motivation scores| Successful new insights, environment probes |

## Technical Requirements

- `motivational_model_engine()` runs on timer or after task cycles.
- Must interface with:
  - `memory_agent.fetch_open_threads()`
  - `reinforcement_agent.get_task_scores()`
  - `orchestrator.submit_task(prompt, motivation_origin)`
- Motivations stored in PostgreSQL table `nyx.motivational_state`.

## Safety & Constraints

- **Loop Guardrails:** Max motivations per tick; max recursion depth.
- **Veto Conditions:** Validator agent can block unethical/unsafe actions.
- **Override Trigger:** External input takes precedence over internal drives.

## Notes on Boredom and Idle States

Include `idle_exploration` or `boredom` as a motivation:
- Triggered when: no active tasks, low urgency/satisfaction scores, external inactivity.
- May lead to: self-assessment, environmental querying, self-diagnostic scans, or reflective task generation (e.g. “What do I not know about my tools?”).
