## Questions for Next Development Phase

1. **LLM Integration Scope**: Should we implement prompt template caching and optimization initially?
2. **Agent Complexity**: Start with simple task agents or include council agent capabilities?
3. **Error Handling**: How aggressive should retry logic be for LLM API failures?
