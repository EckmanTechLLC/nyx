## Development Approach

**REVISED Strategy: Autonomous Intelligence Development**
1. ✅ Database foundation (complete and tested)
2. ✅ LLM integration with native prompt caching (operational)
3. ✅ Core agent system (Task, Council, Validator, Memory agents operational)
4. ✅ TopLevelOrchestrator (production-ready workflow orchestration)
5. ✅ SubOrchestrator (production-ready recursive task decomposition)
6. ✅ **Active Learning System** (scoring, pattern recognition, adaptation - COMPLETE & INTEGRATED)
7. ✅ **Tool Interface Layer** (production-ready with safety validation and database integration)
8. 🎯 **Current Phase: FastAPI Application** (REST API with learning dashboard)
9. ⭐ **Next Phase: Motivational Model** (autonomous goal selection - HIGH IMPACT)
10. 🚀 **Future Phases: Memory Enhancement, Tool Evolution, Security & Tracing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
11. ⚠️ **Later Phases: Meta-Cognition, Reasoning Robustness** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
12. 📋 **Deferred Phases: Environmental Perception, Distributed Architecture** (LOWER PRIORITY)

**Testing Philosophy:** ⚠️ **CRITICAL SAFETY UPDATE**
- **ALL TESTS MUST RUN IN DOCKER CONTAINERS** - No exceptions for safety
- **NYX EXECUTION PROHIBITED OUTSIDE CONTAINERS** - Assistant never executes NYX directly
- Individual component test scripts for isolated testing (containerized)
- Database integration tests for data persistence (containerized)
- End-to-end workflow tests once core components are ready (containerized)
- No mock data - all real database and API interactions (within container isolation)

## Questions for Next Development Phase

1. **LLM Integration Scope**: Should we implement prompt template caching and optimization initially?
2. **Agent Complexity**: Start with simple task agents or include council agent capabilities?
3. **Error Handling**: How aggressive should retry logic be for LLM API failures?
4. **Resource Limits**: Should we implement circuit breakers for API rate limiting?
5. **Testing Depth**: How comprehensive should individual component tests be?

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Items:**
- Database operations (proven and tested)
- Configuration management (working)
- Basic file structure (established)

**Medium Risk Items:**
- Claude API integration (rate limits, costs)
- Agent state management (complexity)
- Recursive orchestration (potential infinite loops)

**High Risk Items:**
- Resource management under load (untested)
- Cross-agent communication at scale (untested)
- Cost management with extensive LLM usage (budget impact)
