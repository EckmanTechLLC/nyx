### 2. Integration Points

#### **TopLevelOrchestrator Learning Integration**
```python

async def _select_strategy(self, workflow_input, complexity):
    # Learning-based recommendation with confidence threshold
    recommendation = await adaptive_engine.recommend_strategy(...)
    if recommended_strategy and recommendation.confidence > 0.6:
        return recommended_strategy
    # Fallback to heuristic selection
```

#### **Real-time Adaptation Integration**
```python
# Performance-based Adaptation
async def _check_adaptation_triggers(self):
    adaptation_rec = await adaptive_engine.should_adapt_workflow(...)
    if adaptation_rec:
        await self._execute_learning_adaptations(adaptation_rec)
```

#### **Automatic Scoring Integration**
```python
# Post-execution Scoring
async def _process_final_results(self, execution_result):
    # Schedule scoring in background
    asyncio.create_task(self._score_workflow_execution(orchestrator_result))
```

### 3. Database Schema Utilization

The implementation leverages existing database fields in the `thought_trees` table:

    workflow_input, complexity_analysis
)

# Analyze patterns
patterns = await pattern_analyzer.analyze_strategy_patterns()

# Score specific execution  
scoring_result = await performance_scorer.score_workflow_execution(
    thought_tree_id, start_time, end_time, context
)
