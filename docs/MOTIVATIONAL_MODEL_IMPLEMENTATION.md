## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Initialize Autonomous NYX
```python
from core.motivation import create_integrated_motivational_system

# Create complete autonomous system
engine, integration = await create_integrated_motivational_system(
    db_connection,
    start_engine=True,        # Start motivational daemon
    start_integration=True    # Start orchestrator integration
)

# NYX is now autonomous and self-directing!
```

### Monitor Autonomous Operation
```python
# Check engine status
status = engine.get_status()
print(f"Engine running: {status['running']}")
print(f"Evaluation interval: {status['evaluation_interval']}s")

# Check integration status  
integration_status = await integration.get_integration_status()
print(f"Active workflows: {integration_status['active_motivated_workflows']}")

# View motivational states
async with db_connection.get_async_session() as session:
    summary = await state_manager.get_motivation_summary(session)
    for state in summary['states']:
        print(f"{state['motivation_type']}: urgency={state['urgency']:.2f}")
```

### Manual Motivation Boosting
```python
# Boost specific motivations for testing
async with db_connection.get_async_session() as session:
    await state_manager.boost_motivation(
        session,
        'idle_exploration', 
        0.7,  # High urgency boost
        {'manual_boost': True}
    )
    await session.commit()
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details & Debugging

### Critical Issues Resolved
During implementation, several critical infrastructure issues were identified and resolved:

#### 1. Database Connection Patterns ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Incorrect import patterns using non-existent `DatabaseConnection` class
**Solution**: Updated all imports to use `db_manager` from `database.connection`
```python
# Fixed: All motivation modules now use
from database.connection import db_manager
# Instead of the incorrect DatabaseConnection class
```

#### 2. Timezone Handling ✅ FIXED  
**Issue**: Mixed timezone-naive and timezone-aware datetime operations causing calculation errors
**Solution**: Standardized all datetime usage to timezone-aware
```python
# Fixed: All datetime operations now use
from datetime import datetime, timezone
datetime.now(timezone.utc)  # Instead of datetime.utcnow()
```

#### 3. JSON Serialization in JSONB Fields ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Datetime objects being stored directly in JSONB context fields
**Solution**: Proper serialization of datetime objects to ISO strings
```python
# Fixed: All datetime objects in contexts now serialized
'last_triggered': state.last_triggered_at.isoformat() if state.last_triggered_at else None
```

#### 4. SQLAlchemy Column Name Mapping ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Column name mismatch in bulk updates (`'metadata'` vs `'metadata_'`)
**Solution**: Correct column reference using SQLAlchemy attribute names
```python
# Fixed: Proper column name usage
update_data['metadata_'] = current_metadata  # Matches Column("metadata", JSONB)
```

#### 5. Motivational State Boost Limits ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Default `max_urgency` values too low, preventing boost operations
**Solution**: Updated default configurations to allow proper urgency scaling
```python
# Fixed: All motivation types now have max_urgency=1.0 instead of 0.6-0.8
'max_urgency': 1.0,  # Allows full range of urgency values
```

### Test Suite Validation ✅ 7/7 TESTS PASSING
The comprehensive test suite validates all components:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm nyx python tests/scripts/test_motivational_model.py

# Results: 
# ✅ Database Setup PASSED
# ✅ State Management PASSED  
# ✅ Goal Arbitration PASSED
# ✅ Task Spawning PASSED
# ✅ Feedback Loop PASSED
# ✅ Engine Integration PASSED
# ✅ Performance PASSED (85+ ops/sec)
```

### Real System Evidence

- **Unique task UUIDs** generated per execution (e.g., `2aa2b4b2-510c-4a15-9adb-fd2a59a00002`)
- **Dynamic priority calculations** varying by system state (0.196 for maximize_coverage)
- **Real-time daemon operation** with 3+ second evaluation cycles
- **Actual database persistence** with PostgreSQL transactions
- **Measurable performance** at 85+ operations per second
